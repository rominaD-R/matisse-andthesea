        Matisse is known to have expressed himself through widely varying
        mediums and visual languages throughout his career. One could look at
        two works by Matisse from different points in his life and never guess
        they were made by the same hands. For the next few months at the Saint
        Louis Art Museum, we do have the opportunity to engage these diverse
        modes of expression across the wall from one another. In these rooms,
        acknowledging the eclecticism of Matisse’s style comes in tandem with
        acknowledging his simultaneous continuity. We can consider Matisse’s
        engagement with the sea as one of many artistic fixations that thread
        together the artist’s life on paper, canvas, or sculpted object.
        Matisse’s lifelong fascination with the sea, juxtaposed by his
        remarkably fluctuating style and use of material, gives us a particular
        insight into his creative process. The exhibition is a remarkable
        opportunity for fellow artists to put their art practices face-to-face
        with the art practice of a canonical giant.

        Specifics: The day will be split into a lecture and two work sessions:
        <ul>
          <li>At 11:30am, there will be a short lecture on Matisse’s exploration of different mediums, fluctuation and style, and creative process specifically as it is revealed by the x-ray study of Bathers with a Turtle.
          </li>
          <li>From 12:00-1:30pm, the artists will be asked to choose a piece and interpret it in the visual language of another piece by Mattisse hanging in the exhibition.
          </li>
          <li>From 2:00-3:30pm, after a brief lunch break, artists will have the opportunity to copy a work by Mattisse in their own style or a style of their choosing. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br/>
