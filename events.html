    <p>
      Matisse is known to have expressed himself through widely varying mediums
      and visual languages throughout his career. One could look at two works by
      Matisse from different points in his life and never guess they were made
      by the same hands. For the next few months at the Saint Louis Art Museum,
      we do have the opportunity to engage these diverse modes of expression
      across the wall from one another. In these rooms, acknowledging the
      eclecticism of Matisse’s style comes in tandem with acknowledging his
      simultaneous continuity. We can consider Matisse’s engagement with the sea
      as one of many artistic fixations that thread together the artist’s life
      on paper, canvas, or sculpted object. Matisse’s lifelong fascination with
      the sea, juxtaposed by his remarkably fluctuating style and use of
      material, gives us a particular insight into his creative process. The
      exhibition is a remarkable opportunity for fellow artists to put their art
      practices face-to-face with the art practice of a canonical giant.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This will be an afternoon where the exhibition becomes a space for
        artists to bring their art-practice face to face with works by Matisse.
      </li>
      <li>
        It will be split into two sessions: First, the artists will be asked to
        choose a piece and interpret it in the visual language of another piece
        by Matisse hanging in the exhibition. In the second part, artists will
        have the opportunity to copy a work by Matisse in their own style or a
        style of their choosing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Easels will be provided, but the artists will be asked to bring their
        own materials. The mediums will be restricted to oil painting; drawing
        (graphite, ink, charcoal, chalk, colored pencil, etc– but please inform
        us beforehand if you wish to bring a material not mentioned on this
        list)
      </li>
