        <h1>Matisse and the Sea at SLAM</h1>
        <p>
          Matisse and the Sea is the first exhibition at the St. Louis Art
          Museum to examine the significance of the sea across Modernist artist
          Henri Matisse’s career, which included artwork in coastal locations on
          the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. Marine imagery was
          an important catalyst for Matisse’s artistic experimentation—most
          notably in the Saint Louis Art Museum’s own iconic painting Bathers
          with a Turtle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exhibition includes imagery ranging from Matisse’s early panoramic
          marine views in the South of France to his late paper cutouts,
          representing life beneath the waves, which were inspired by his visit
          to Tahiti in 1930. It offers an opportunity to explore the artist’s
          travel across his career as well as the global influences that
          informed his art, particularly African sculptures and masks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matisse and the Sea will include a wide range of works in many media,
          including paintings, sculptures, paper cut-outs, drawings, prints,
          ceramics, and textiles. It will be accompanied by a scholarly
          exhibition catalogue.

        <h1>About Matisse</h1>
        <p>
         Henri Matisse was a French artist, known for his bold use of color. Matisse was born in 1869 in
         Northern France, and started studying art in 1891. Under his first teacher Gustave Moreau, Matisse 
         began with Classical art, painting landscapes and still life. However, Matisse was soon introduced to 
         Impressionism and became an Impressionist himself, drawn in with their use of color, strokes, and
         shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matisse would become one of the founders of Fauvism, extreme use of intense color and simplistic shapes/forms.
          This where Matisse became more in tune with using such bright colors, such as in pieces like <em>Woman with
          a Hat</em> and <em>Collioure in August</em>. However, his life took a turn around WWII, when his wife divorced
          him, his daughter tortured by Nazis, and Matisse was diagnosed with stomach cancer. In his last years, Matisse 
          dedicated the rest of his work to cutouts, with the help of assistants.

        <h1>About Modern Art in the Mediterranean</h1>
        <p>
            Modern Art in the Mediterranean is a course at Washington University in
            St. Louis taught by professor Lacy Murphy to analyze art in the Mediterranean
            area, especially from colonial influence such as France in the early 19th century
            and Orientalism and reclaiming of Islamic/North African art.
