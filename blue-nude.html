        Matisse began cutouts in the 1940s. The four Blue Nudes above were all
        based on the same pose, a nude female with intertwined legs and her arm
        over her head, thus why they have the same name but with increasing
        numbers.

            Matisse was born in Northern France in 1869. He originally went to
            study law in 1887, but then found his passion in painting, and went
            to École Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris to study art.

            While Matisse was first taught traditional Classicism with still lifes and
            realistic portrayals, he was later introduced to Impressionism, an art style
            that had visible brush strokes and an unusual blending of colors to create
            a sort of vibration. Matisse experimented with Impressionism, definitely
            inspiring his later use of bright colors.

            Matisse traveled to multiple countries in Africa and Oceania, where the people,
            local art, and landscapes inspired him further in abstraction. He would buy
            and collect 'antiques' from these countries, such as African sculptures and 
            Polynesian rugs.

            From his trip to the Tahitian islands in 1930 and gaining stomach cancer 
            in 1941, Matisse started doing only cutout pieces. Matisse had to use a 
            wheelchair and was often bedbound, so cutting paper (with the help of his 
            studio assistants) was his best option to continue his art, until his 
            passing in 1954.

            Matisse before was an impressionist artist, such as with his first
            <em>Blue Nude</em> (1907)

            Matisse was also a founder in Fauvism, which prioritized color,
            especially using color straight out of the tube. We can see it in
            his background for <em>Bathers with a Turtle</em> (1907)
          </p>

            His journey in rejecting the canon European art and more into his
            "Modern" art, Matisse took inspiration from his African sculpture.
            (below are his purchased <em>Jomooniw Male and Female Figures</em>)
            by a Bamana artist.

            From his trip to the Tahitian islands in 1930 and his revelation in
            Islamic art, Matisse was inspired into crating his cut out
            piece—specifically, the shapes and lineless forms replicated from
            Polynesian and Islam art. A great example is his tapestry piece
            <em>Oceania, The Sky</em> (1946) which tries to replicate the cloths
            he collected from Oceania islands.

            First, Matisse painted a big paper canvas with one color, 
            straight out of the tube.
          </p>
          <img
            src="img/painting_paper.gif"

          <p>
            He then (with the help of his assistants) cut out fluid and organic
            shapes with scissors
          </p>
          <img

        <div class="scroll-item">
          <p>
            With pins, he placed the cut out shapes onto a bigger paper canvas,
            repeating the process until he was satisfied. After he found the
            final position, he glued the cutout goache-painted paper onto the
            background/canvas paper.
